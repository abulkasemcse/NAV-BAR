# NAV-BAR
With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size. A standard navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xl|lg|md|sm (stacks the navbar vertically on extra large, large, medium or small screens).
